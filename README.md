🏥 HealthTest AI – AI-Powered Healthcare Test Case Generation

HealthTest AI is an intelligent solution that transforms healthcare software requirements into structured, compliant, and traceable test cases. It leverages AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning to analyze requirements, generate test steps, assign priorities, and embed compliance standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, and ISO 13485.

This tool helps healthcare teams reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and accelerate test coverage while ensuring compliance with international healthcare regulations.

🚀 Features

📌 AI-Powered Requirement Analysis – Converts natural language healthcare requirements into test cases.

🛡️ Compliance Assurance – Auto-includes HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, and ISO standards in test cases.

📊 Traceability Matrix – Maps requirements to generated test cases for full audit readiness.

⚡ Priority Tagging – Automatically assigns criticality levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

🔗 Seamless Integrations – Export or push test cases to Jira, TestRail, Azure DevOps.

📥 Export Options – Download test cases in JSON, CSV, or PDF formats.

🏗️ Architecture Overview

Requirement Input – User enters healthcare requirement.

AI/NLP Engine – Parses requirement and identifies type (functional, security, privacy, compliance).

Test Case Generator – Produces test steps, expected outcomes, priority, and compliance tags.

Traceability Matrix – Links requirements to generated test cases.

Integrations – Export or push test cases to enterprise QA tools.
